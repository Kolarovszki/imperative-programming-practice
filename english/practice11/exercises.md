# Mandatory tasks

1. Create a new type called` Student` to represent students. Include ID,
   average, and age. The type of average should be a double-precision
floating-point number, the rest integers.   Examine the memory requirements of
the type, experiment with the order of the data members and observe its effect.

2. For convenience, create an alias type with typedef so that you can use the
   type without the struct prefix.

3. Create a function that gets an `Student` array and returns the ID of the
   highest average student.

4. Treat BSc, MSc and PhD students separately, create an enum as `Type` and add
   it to the Student as a data member.

5. Depending on the type of student, store different extra data using a union
   type.   BSc: total number of courses taken (int).   MSc: Aggregate Adjusted
Credit Index (double)   PhD: the impact factor of a journal with the highest
impact factor into which it has published (double) or Erd≈ës number (int) using
a struct.   Let's look at the memory requirements of the type and compare what
it would have been like to use struct instead.

6. Write a function (student_init) which, receiving a `Type` parameter, creates
   a` Student` instance on the heap with the appropriate `Type`, populates the
corresponding data members with random data, and then returns a pointer to the
instance.

7. Load an array with pointers to such `Student` instances, and then modify the
   function written in Task 3 to return a pointer to the instance instead of an
identifier. Beware of memory leaks.

# Optional tasks

1. For the matrix multiplication written in the previous lesson, create a
   `Matrix` type that contains the size of the dimensions of the matrix and a
pointer to the first element of the array as a data member.

2. To facilitate indexing, write a `at` function that waits for a pointer, row
   and column index on a matrix instance, based on which it returns to the
element marked by the indexes with a pointer.

3. Transform the matrix multiplication using these.

# Advanced tasks

1. Create a dynamic array type with integers that stores the current size,
   capacity, and pointer to an array as a data member.

2. Create a function that creates a new instance based on the initial capacity
   received as a parameter, with properly configured data members. Then a pair
of this, which appropriately releases the resulting copy.

3. Write a function that can be used to add an element to the end of an array.
   When the array is full, allocate an array twice as large, then copy the
previous items and update the data members. Beware of memory leaks.
